Aloha! I apologize for the late notice, but we were just informed by HPD that Police Activity League (P.A.L.) basketball will be sponsored again primarily for elementary and middle school students attending Moanalua Elementary and Middle Schools as well as those residing in the community.

Registration starts on Monday, December 6th (on-line only) for boys and girls, grades 1 â€“ 6; and for boys and girls grades 7-8. Practices will be held at the courts next to the swimming pool, and also at the School Courts after 5:00 pm, if we are able to secure permits. Days and times will be decided by coaches and the MAC Athletic Club director. Games are scheduled on weekends and evenings.

Registration fees will be $30.00 and all participants must be registered with the Moanalua Athletic Club and P.A.L. Participants should also wear athletic shoes and shorts and will not be required to wear masks but coaches will need to wear masks during practice and games.

We are desperately in need of coaches at all levels and hope to have a minimum of two coaches at the court at all times. Please let me know if you are willing and able or know someone who is.
