We were just informed by HPD that Police Activity League (P.A.L.) volleyball will be sponsored again primarily for elementary and middle school students attending Moanalua Elementary and Middle Schools as well as those residing in the community.

Please stay tuned as we finalize the signup period.

Registration fees will be $30.00 and all participants must be registered with the Moanalua Athletic Club and P.A.L.

If you have any questions, you can e-mail me, Dennis Arakaki at: [palmoanalua@gmail.com](mailto:palmoanalua@gmail.com).

You may also contact the director, Officer Marc Higa at [Honolulupd.org/pal](https://www.honolulupd.org/pal/)

Me ke aloha, Dennis Arakaki, MAC Volleyball Director
