The Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) and POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE (PAL) will attempt to expand the Moanalua Baseball program for 2023. We have a few parents who are willing to resurrect the MAC baseball program.

We are committing to the MUSTANG (ages 9 & 10) and PINTO (Ages 7 & 8). The age determination date is the childâ€™s age on January 1, 2023. Teams are for boys and girls (co-ed). We may accept Jr. Pinto players (5 & 6-year-olds) if they are willing to join the Pinto team.

The registration period will be from May 10 - 16, 2023. Practices will start on Tuesday, May 16, 2023. The season is scheduled to run from May 24, 2023, and will end on July 20, 2023. All registrants will be accepted once we receive their registration form and fee. 

See our [baseball](/baseball) page for more information and sign-up link.
