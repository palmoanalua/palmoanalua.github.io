We received a late request to have baseball at Moanalua with a commitment from a community member to be head coach for a Mustang team.
(We still need a head coach for the Pinto/Jr. Pinto team!!!)

Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) & POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE (PAL) will grant us a late start if we make a commitment to form a team or two.
We are looking at having a Mustang team, ages 9 & 10 and, if we can recruit a coach, a combined Pinto/Jr. Pinto team.
The MAC baseball program, like other sports, is primarily for boys and girls residing in the Moanalua area (Fort Shafter to Red Hill and mauka of the freeway) or attending Moanalua Elementary or Middle School.)

See our [baseball](/baseball) page for more information and sign-up link.
