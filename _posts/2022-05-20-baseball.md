Welcome to the Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE (PAL) Baseball program for 2022.  The program has been on “pause” for the past three years, but a group of interested parents are attempting to resurrect the program on a limited basis, rather than going the full range of the program as it once was.

The MAC 2022 baseball registration period is scheduled for May 20 thru 26.  Registration is ONLINE ONLY.
See our [baseball](/baseball) page for important changes to the 2022 Baseball Program.

Payment for registered players will be IN-PERSON at the Moanalua Community Park on May 27 and 28. Times to be announced.
