The Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) serves the Moanalua community with volunteer run baseball, basketball,
and volleyball programs for multiple age groups. Each year we host at least one team in each age division, if there
are sufficient players, to participate in the Police Activity League (PAL) in our geographic area.

The MAC programs are primarily for youth residing in the Moanalua area (Fort Shafter to Red Hill and mauka of the freeway), or attending Moanalua Elementary or Middle Schools.

Our programs start with children in the Jr. Pinto age division between the ages of 5 and 6, and can go up to the Pony age division with players between the ages of 13 and 14.
