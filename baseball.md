MAC 2023 Baseball Program
----------------------------------
The Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) and POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE (PAL) will attempt to expand the Moanalua Baseball program for 2023.
We have a few parents who are willing to resurrect the MAC baseball program, which, like other sports, is primarily for boys and girls residing in the Moanalua area (Fort Shafter to Red Hill and mauka of the freeway) or attending Moanalua Elementary School. 

Sign-up Process
---------------
1. Interested players must sign-up ONLINE at this website during the sign-up period (May 10 - 16, 2023).
1. Parent/Guardians will receive an email from the league coordinator containing the PAL registration form and payment instructions.
1. Parent/Guardians should complete the form and send the form and payment to the league coordinator.

**A completed registration form and payment must be received before a player is assigned to a team.**

Program Information
-------------------
We are committing to the MUSTANG (ages 9 & 10) and PINTO (Ages 7 & 8).
Teams are for boys and girls (co-ed).
We may accept Jr. Pinto players (5 & 6-year-olds) if they are willing to join the Pinto team.

* Jr. Pinto - Ages 5 & 6 (May be asked to join Pinto age group)
* Pinto - Ages 7 & 8

We will not form a team unless we have minimum amount of coaches, including a head coach for each age group.

* If we lack the minimum of amount of players, we will not form a team but may move the child to an older age group.

1. Players who have obtained a Geographic Exception to Moanalua Elementary School
