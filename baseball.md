MAC 2022 Baseball Program
----------------------------------
Welcome to the Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE (PAL) Baseball program for 2022.  The program has been on “pause” for the past three years, but a group of interested parents are attempting to resurrect the program on a limited basis, rather than going the full range of the program as it once was.
The MAC baseball program, like other sports, is primarily for youth residing in the Moanalua area (Fort Shafter to Red Hill and mauka of the freeway) or attending Moanalua Elementary or Middle School.

We are committing to the Pinto age division which are children ages 7 & 8 years old (or second and third grade students).  We will also consider forming teams in the Jr. Pinto (Ages 5 & 6) and Mustang (Ages 9 & 10) age groups. The age determination date is the child’s age on January 1, 2022. Teams are for boys and girls (co-ed).

The registration period will be from May 20 through 26, 2022.
Practices will start on Thursday, May 26 & Saturday, May 28, 2022.
The season is scheduled to run from June 4, 2022 and will end on July 30, 2022.

All registrants will be accepted once we receive their registration form and fee at the Moanalua Community Park on May 27 and 28, times to be announced.

Registration fees will be:
* Jr. Pintos - $75.00
* Pintos – $85.00
* Mustangs - $85.00

Please note that we will not form a team unless we have minimum amount of coaches, including a head coach, for each age group.
In the event that we lack the minimum of amount of players, we will not form a team but will consider holding practices on a limited basis.
Besides coaches, we will need to have a required amount of equipment required by PAL and the availability of practice fields for each team.
The minimum amount of players is 9 and the maximum is 18. 

The priority for selection is as follows:
1. Head coach and assistant coaches children
1. Players living in the Moanalua Elementary District
1. Players who have obtained a Geographic Exception to Moanalua Elementary School
1. All others
