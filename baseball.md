MAC 2024 Baseball Program
----------------------------------
Moanalua Athletic Club (MAC) & POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE (PAL) will grant us a late start if we make a commitment to form a team or two.
We are looking at having a Mustang team, ages 9 & 10 and, if we can recruit a coach, a combined Pinto/Jr. Pinto team.
The MAC baseball program, like other sports, is primarily for boys and girls residing in the Moanalua area (Fort Shafter to Red Hill and mauka of the freeway) or attending Moanalua Elementary or Middle School.)

The Pinto team is for ages 7 & 8 (grades 2 & 3) and will consider accepting Jr. Pintos, Ages 5 & 6, (grades K-1).
We will definitely have a Mustang Team, Ages 9 & 10 (grades 4 & 5).
The age determination date is the child’s age on January 1, 2024.
Teams are for boys and girls (co-ed).

The registration fee for all age groups will be $75.00, which will include a team jersey, baseball pants and caps.
ANY SURPLUS COLLECTED WILL GO TO PURCHASING BASEBALL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES.
